# Upcycling a Yokogawa Milliampere Meter  

With an Arduino, an electret microphone by Elegoo (this model is analog and digital triggerable via a trimmer), and some NeoPixel RBG LED by Adafruita vintage 1975 Yokogawa milliampere meter has been restored and upcycled to a reactive sound sensor light and gauge VU meter indicator.
